                Hello! I am Faran, soon to be a full stack web developer. I have experience in C#, but majority of
                my experience goes to physical security and designing physical security protocols. Also have minor
                experience in law-enforcement.<br><br>

                I am originally from Iran. In 2010 I made a decision to relocate and move to United States, and
                this was a great change and very interesting. Before moving to US I attended IT Professional University
                in Iran, and that’s where I learned how to work with C#. After learning this programing language, I
                have designed and supported many windows based software for auto dealerships and fast foods. <br><br>

                On this interesting road to US, I had to switch career path because of my degree evaluation with
                department
                of education here. It was very challenging but nothing that I couldn’t do! Designing security protocols
                it
                could be really interesting or very boring, it is absolutely different for every single person. But now,
                I am
                trying to go back to the field that I have lots of love and passion for, and I am %100 sure that this
                is the right field of work for me.<br><br>

                Outside of work I enjoy playing ping-pong and football with my friends and family.<br><br>

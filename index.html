        <p>My name is Faran Navazi, and I'm a soon to be full 
            stack web developer. I am originally from Iran.
            love getting to know people and show them my new tech-toy.

            In my spare time I enjoy being active, 
            play ping-pong, go to flag football with some friends. 
            I actively work on wrighting codes, practice different coding 
            languages and generally anything technologically related.
            I have had a sireous interest in coding since i was little.
            I've been on a computer doing something since I can remember.
